# Who is the course for?

This workshop is designed for healthcare operations researchers, supply chain analysts, and graduate students interested in modeling system dynamics under uncertainty. Participants will learn how Continuous-Time Markov Chains (CTMCs) and basic queueing models can be applied to real-world healthcare logistics. The course assumes basic familiarity with probability and matrix operations in R (or Python).



# Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, participants will be able to:

- Understand the key components and assumptions of Continuous-Time Markov Chains (CTMCs)
- Construct and analyze generator matrices for small-scale CTMC models
- Calculate steady-state probabilities for CTMCs using linear algebra
- Apply queueing theory to model service systems like clinics and pharmacies
- Distinguish between M/M/1, M/M/s, and M/M/s/b systems and assess their implications
- Simulate and interpret Markovian queueing systems in R
- Connect model insights to operational decisions in healthcare delivery (e.g., capacity planning, congestion, patient flow)



# Prerequisites

- Familiarity with random variables and basic probability concepts
- Experience with R or Python for numerical computations and plotting
- No prior knowledge of CTMCs or queueing theory is required
