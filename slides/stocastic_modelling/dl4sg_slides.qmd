## Continuous Time Markov Chains (CTMC)

- In a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC), the system state can change at any point on the continuous time axis.

![](images/ctmc.png)

## Exponential Timing in CTMCs

- **Assumption**: Time until the next transition follows an **Exponential(λ)** distribution, where **λ is the transition rate** (higher λ → shorter expected time between transitions) 
- **Memoryless Property**:  
    $$ 
    \Pr(X > t + u \mid X > u) = \Pr(X > t) $$
- Past time in a state doesn’t affect future transitions
- Transition probability depends only on the **current state** → **Markov property**

## CTMCs: Definition

> **A continuous-time Markov chain** is a stochastic process  
>  
> $$
> \{X(t) \mid t \geq 0\}
> $$
>
> in which the probability of some future event (say \( A \)) depends **only** on the **current state**, not on past states.
>
> Formally:
>
> $$
> \Pr(A \mid X(t),\, 0 \leq t \leq T) = \Pr(A \mid X(T))
> $$


As in the discrete-time case, the key idea is:  **future behavior depends only on the current state**.

## CTMC Example: Managing a Tiny Shop's Flow

Imagine a **small neighborhood pharmacy** with space for **maximum of two customers at a time**. As the shop owner, you're analyzing foot traffic to optimize customer experience without overcrowding or turning people away.


![](images/ctmc_example.png){height=200%, fig-align="center"}


## CTMC Example: Managing a Tiny Shop's Flow Cont.

- **Arrivals** follow an exponential distribution with **λ = 1 per minute**
- **Departures** depend on how many customers are in the shop:
    - **1 customer** → exponential(λ = 0.25)
    - **2 customers** → exponential(λ = 0.5)
- If a new customer arrives:
    - And there are **0 or 1 customers**, they enter the shop
    - If **2 customers** are already inside, they **leave without entering** (no queueing!)


## CTMC Example: Transition Rate Diagram

- We can model this scenario as a **Continuous-Time Markov Chain (CTMC)**, where the **state** represents the **number of customers in the shop**.
- Thus, the possible states are: `0`, `1`, and `2`.
- We can visualize the **transition rates** between these states:

![](images/ctmc_transition_diagram.png){width=70%, fig-align="center"}

## Time Until Next Transition

Let $T_i$ be the time until the next transition from state $i \in \{0, 1, 2\}$

- $T_0 \sim \text{Exp}(1)$  *(arrival triggers transition)*

- $T_2 \sim \text{Exp}(0.5)$ *(departure triggers transition)*

- $T_1 = \min(A, D)$, where:
    - $A \sim \text{Exp}(1)$ *(a new customer arrives)*
    - $D \sim \text{Exp}(0.25)$ *(a customer leaves the shop)*

## Exponential Minimum Property

Suppose  $T_1$, $T_2$ are independent and
$$
T_1 \sim \text{Exp}(\lambda_1),\quad T_2 \sim \text{Exp}(\lambda_2)
$$

Then:  
$$
\min(T_1, T_2) \sim \text{Exp}(\lambda_1 + \lambda_2)
$$

## Exponential Minimum Property Cont.

**Application to our example:**

- For state 1:  
$$
T_1 = \min(A, D); \quad A \sim \text{Exp}(1),\ D \sim \text{Exp}(0.25)
$$ 
- So:  
$$
T_1 \sim \text{Exp}(1 + 0.25) = \text{Exp}(1.25)
$$

## Generator Matrix for a CTMC

The **generator matrix (Q)** summarizes the transition rates between states in a CTMC.

- Each element $q_{ij}$ gives the **rate of moving from state $i$ to state $j$**
- **Diagonal elements** are negative and equal to the **negative of the row sum**
- **Non-diagonal elements** are $\geq 0$ and indicate direct transitions

## Interpreting Key Entries in Generator Matrix

![](images/generator_matrix.png){width=100%}

## Steady-State Probabilities

**Steady-state probabilities** represent the long-run behavior of the system.  
They tell us:

- The **proportion of time** the CTMC spends in each state in the long run.
- The **limiting probability** that the system is in a given state after a long time.

To find them, we solve:
$$
\boldsymbol{\pi} \mathbf{Q} = \mathbf{0}, \quad \text{with} \quad \sum \pi_i = 1
$$

---

## Solving the System

From:

- $-\pi_0 + 0.25\pi_1 = 0 \Rightarrow \pi_1 = 4\pi_0$
- $\pi_1 - 0.5\pi_2 = 0 \Rightarrow \pi_2 = 2\pi_1 = 8\pi_0$
- $\pi_0 + 4\pi_0 + 8\pi_0 = 13\pi_0 = 1 \Rightarrow \pi_0 = \frac{1}{13}$

Thus:
$$
\pi_0 = \frac{1}{13},\quad \pi_1 = \frac{4}{13},\quad \pi_2 = \frac{8}{13}
$$

---

## Long-run Average Number of Customers

We calculate:

$$
0 \cdot \frac{1}{13} + 1 \cdot \frac{4}{13} + 2 \cdot \frac{8}{13} = \frac{20}{13} \approx 1.54
$$

This is the expected number of customers in the shop in the long run.

---

## Summary of CTMCs

- Transition times are exponentially distributed.
- The **generator matrix $\mathbf{Q}$** defines transition rates.
- Steady-state $\boldsymbol{\pi}$ solves:  
    $$
    \boldsymbol{\pi} \mathbf{Q} = 0, \quad \sum \pi_i = 1
    $$
- $\pi_i$ gives long-run proportions of time spent in each state.

## Queueing Systems as CTMCs

A queueing system (e.g., customer service desk, call center, clinic) can often be modeled as a **continuous-time Markov chain**, under assumptions like:

- Exponentially-distributed inter-arrival times
- Exponentially-distributed service times
- Finite waiting area, single server, and one-at-a-time processing

## Queueing Theory
<br>
<br>
Welcome to Queueing Theory!  
We'll explore how to model and analyze systems where "waiting" happens — like hospitals, call centers, and shops.


## What is a Queueing System?

A system with:

- **Arrivals** (e.g., customers, calls)
- **A queue** (optional)
- **Service process** (1 or more servers)
- **Departures**

![](images/queing_basic.png){width=100%, fig-align="center"}

## Real-World Applications

- ATM and supermarket checkout lines
- Call centers and helpdesks
- Hospital patient flow
- Computer servers and networks


## Kendall’s Standard Notation

Queueing systems are described using: **A/B/S/d/e**  

- **A** – Arrival distribution (e.g., M = Exponential)
- **B** – Service distribution (e.g., M, D = Deterministic, G = General)
- **S** – Number of servers
- **d** – System capacity (buffer size)
- **e** – Queue discipline (e.g., FIFO, LIFO)


**Example: M/M/2/5/FIFO**  

→ Exponential arrivals, exponential service, 2 servers,  
→ Max 5 customers in system, served in order of arrival

## Poisson Process 

- Many queueing systems assume **Poisson arrivals**, a key foundation for M/M/1 and related models.
- This process is simple but powerful and forms the basis for most queueing models.

**Definition:**  
A Poisson process with rate $\lambda$ models **random arrivals over time**, where:

![](images/poisson_process.png){width=100%, fig-align="center"}


## Poisson Process Cont.

- The number of arrivals in time $t$ follows:  
  $$
  P(N(t) = k) = \frac{(\lambda t)^k e^{-\lambda t}}{k!}
  $$
- **Interarrival times** are exponentially distributed:  
  $$
  T \sim \text{Exp}(\lambda)
  $$
- **Memoryless**: the probability of arrival doesn't depend on the past

## The M/M/1 Queue

![](images/mm1.png){width=100%, fig-align="center"}

- A single-server queue with:
    - **Exponential interarrival times** (rate $\lambda$)
    - **Exponential service times** (rate $\mu$)
- The number of customers in the system defines the **state**
- The queue has **infinite capacity**

## The M/M/1 Queue Cont.

**Traffic intensity:**  
$$
\rho = \frac{\lambda}{\mu}
$$

- If $\rho < 1$, the system reaches a **steady-state**
- If $\rho \geq 1$, the queue grows indefinitely
- $\lambda$ = arrival rate, $\mu$ = service rate

💡 Think of $\rho$ as the **load** on the server.  
If arrivals outpace service, the system can't cope.

## M/M/1 as a CTMC

- The M/M/1 queue can be modeled as a **Continuous-Time Markov Chain (CTMC)** with **states** representing the number of customers in the system.

- It forms a **birth-death process**:
    - **Arrivals (births)** at rate $\lambda$
    - **Departures (deaths)** at rate $\mu$

## M/M/1 as a CTMC Cont.

**Generator matrix (Q):**

$$
\mathbf{Q} =
\begin{pmatrix}
 -\lambda & \lambda & 0 & 0 & \cdots \\
 \mu & -(\lambda + \mu) & \lambda & 0 & \cdots \\
 0 & \mu & -(\lambda + \mu) & \lambda & \cdots \\
 \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \ddots & \ddots
\end{pmatrix}
$$

- This structure defines the dynamics of the queue over time.


## M/M/1: Stationary Distribution & Performance

With steady-state probabilities $\{p_n,\ n \geq 0\}$:

- Probability the system is **empty**
    $$
    p_0 = 1 - \rho
    $$
- Probability the **server is busy**
    $$
    1 - p_0 = \rho
    $$
- Probability of **$n$ customers** in the system
    $$
    p_n = \rho^n (1 - \rho)
    $$

## M/M/1: Stationary Distribution & Performance Cont.

**Mean number of customers in the system (L):**

$$
L = \sum_{n=0}^\infty n p_n 
= (1 - \rho) \sum_{n=0}^\infty n \rho^n 
= \frac{\rho}{1 - \rho}
$$

This is one of the key performance metrics in queueing theory.

## Performance Measures in Queueing

Four key summary performance measures:

- **$L$**: Mean number of customers **in the system**
- **$L_q$**: Mean number of customers **in the queue**
- **$W$**: Mean time a customer spends **in the system**
- **$W_q$**: Mean time a customer spends **waiting in the queue**


## Little’s Law

A fundamental relationship linking **arrival rate**, **waiting time**, and **number in the system**.

Relates these measures:

$$
L = \lambda W,\quad L_q = \lambda W_q
$$

Also:

$$
W = W_q + \frac{1}{\mu},\quad L = L_q + \frac{\lambda}{\mu}
$$


## M/M/1 Queue: Performance Formulas

Using $\rho = \frac{\lambda}{\mu}$ and Little’s Law:

- Mean number in the system:
  $$
  L = \frac{\rho}{1 - \rho}
  $$

- Mean number in queue:
  $$
  L_q = \frac{\rho^2}{1 - \rho}
  $$


## M/M/1 Queue: Performance Formulas Cont. 

- Mean time in the system:
  $$
  W = \frac{1}{\mu(1 - \rho)}
  $$

- Mean waiting time in queue:
  $$
  W_q = \frac{\rho}{\mu(1 - \rho)}
  $$

## Let's Practice: Model Matching

You’ll see 3 real-world situations.  
For each one, pick the **most suitable queueing model**:

- M/M/1
- M/M/s
- M/M/s/b

You’ll have **30 seconds** to discuss or decide for each!

<script>
let timerIntervals = {};

function startTimer(buttonId, seconds = 60) {
  const btn = document.getElementById(buttonId);
  if (!btn || isNaN(seconds)) return;

  clearInterval(timerIntervals[buttonId]); // clear any existing timer

  let count = parseInt(seconds, 10); // ensure it's a number
  const tick = () => {
    if (count < 0) {
      clearInterval(timerIntervals[buttonId]);
      btn.innerHTML = "⏰";
      return;
    }
    const mins = String(Math.floor(count / 60)).padStart(2, '0');
    const secs = String(count % 60).padStart(2, '0');
    btn.innerHTML = `⏳ ${mins}:${secs}`;
    count--;
  };

  tick(); // show first value immediately
  timerIntervals[buttonId] = setInterval(tick, 1000);
}
</script>



## Scenario 1

An emergency care unit in a district hospital has five treatment beds. Once all beds are occupied, incoming patients must be transferred to a different facility, as there is no space for waiting or holding.

Which queueing model applies?

## Lab Activity: Vaccine Clinic Operations

In this hands-on session, you’ll use R code to explore how Continuous-Time Markov Chains (CTMCs) and Queueing Theory help us understand operations at a rural vaccine clinic.

We'll work through:

- A **CTMC** model for an observation room with limited space
- An **M/M/1 queue** for a check-in desk staffed by one nurse
- Scenario analysis and steady-state evaluation

> Make sure R and the necessary libraries are ready (e.g., `Matrix`, `expm`).

You’ll be guided with real-world tasks followed by code. Let's begin!
