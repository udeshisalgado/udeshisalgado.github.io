## Thesis title
<br> <br>

<span style="text-align: center; display: block;">Enhancing Global Immunisation Supply Chain: Integrating Hybrid Intelligence Models into Inventory Optimisation Considering Non-Monetary Welfare Metrics</span> 

## Research Problem

### The Problem

In many low- and middle-income countries, **not every child has access to life-saving vaccines**.

This lack of access can be attributed to several factors:

- Vaccine hesitancy and misinformation  
- Geographic inaccessibility and conflict zones  
- Weak health infrastructure and limited cold-chain capacity  
- <span style="color: #20808D;"><strong>Supply chain inefficiencies </strong></span>


## Research Problem 

### Our Focus

Addressing inefficiencies in <span style="color: #20808D;">childhood routine vaccine supply chains</span>, which includes:

- inaccurate forecasting
- standard wastage rates and buffer stock adjustments
- frequent stockouts / missed vaccination opportunities
- poor integration of inventory optimisation
- the exclusion of societal well-being metrics


## Research Problem 

### Why?

- <span style="color: #20808D;">1 in 5 children</span>  worldwide lack access to lifesaving vaccines.
- Annually, <span style="color: #20808D;">1.5 million children under five die</span>  from vaccine-preventable diseases. 
- Although, <span style="color: #20808D;"><strong>Each dollar spent on immunization saves $52</strong></span> in low- and middle-income countries  
  - *Source:* [CDC Global Immunization Fast Facts](https://www.cdc.gov/global-immunization/fast-facts/index.html)  
- By focusing on **childhood routine vaccines** and trying to enhance the supply chain, we contribute save child lives, reduce healthcare inequalities, and enhance the quality of life.


## Research Problem 

### Who?

- The research benefits public health systems, humanitarian organizations (e.g., UNICEF, GAVI), and vulnerable populations in low middle income countries (LMIC)
- It also provides tools and insights for policymakers, researchers, and global health initiatives.

## Research Objectives
1. Review the literature on vaccine forecasting and supply chain management to identify key gaps, challenges, and opportunities for innovation in LMIC contexts.
2. Develop a hybrid intelligence framework that enhances vaccine demand forecasting by integrating probabilistic methods, machine learning, and domain-specific knowledge.

## Research Objectives Cont. 

3. Link forecasting outputs to inventory optimisation by incorporating both monetary and non-monetary welfare metrics into the decision-making process.
4. Investigate how AI-driven predictive models can accurately estimate open vial wastage at the health facility level in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).




## Research Questions

1. How can a hybrid intelligence framework combining domain-specific knowledge and consumption-based probabilistic forecasting be leveraged to improve vaccine demand forecasting across the entire supply chain in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs)?

2. How can an objective/loss function incorporating both monetary and non-monetary welfare metrics (Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs)) optimize vaccine inventory management to maximize fully immunized children in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs)?
