Which state dominates during the transient phase?\nAnswer:\nBased on the convergence plot, the system reaches its equilibrium (steady-state) approximately within 15 to 20 minutes. This is evident from the point at which the probabilities for all three states stabilize and no longer change significantly over time.\nDuring the initial transient phase, the system starts from an empty state (State 0), so the probability of being in State 0 is initially 1. As time progresses, patients begin arriving, and the probability of being in State 1 (one patient in the room) increases briefly. However, this is quickly overtaken by State 2 (two patients in the room), whose probability rises rapidly and becomes the dominant state.\nOnce equilibrium is reached, State 2 clearly dominates, maintaining a high steady-state probability (approximately 88%). This indicates that under the current arrival and observation rates, the clinic operates at or near full capacity for most of the time."

The red curve in the plot shows the average number of patients in the system, while the dashed blue curve represents the variance (i.e., how much the system fluctuates).\nWhen the system is lightly loaded (e.g., \\(\\rho &lt; 0.5\\)), both mean and variance remain low. However, as \\(\\rho\\) approaches 1 ‚Äî meaning patient arrivals nearly match or exceed the nurse‚Äôs capacity to serve them ‚Äî the average number of people waiting increases sharply, and the system becomes unpredictable.\nThis pattern suggests that if the clinic continues to get busier without adding more staff, queues will grow longer and waiting times will become highly variable, making it hard to manage patient flow effectively. Clinic managers should aim to keep traffic intensity well below 1 to ensure smooth and stable operations."
