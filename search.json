Visualize patterns by vaccine type and region. Detect anomalies such as stockouts or overstocking.\n\n\nIII. FORECASTING COMPETITION\nCompare two forecasting approaches:\n- Approach A: Forecast `doses_used = stock_beginning + quantity_received - stock_end`, capturing total consumption.\n- Approach B: Forecast `doses_administered` and `wastage` separately, then sum.\nRun forecast competition including probabilistic and ML models with prediction intervals."
